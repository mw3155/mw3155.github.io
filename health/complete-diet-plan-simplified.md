<summary>Cooking Instructions</summary>

**Notes:**
- The gram amounts for jars are already the drained weight
- I only buy everything in jars, no cans; and always organic
- Fresh vegetables taste better of course, but the nutrients in jars are almost the same
- Soak freekeh the evening before in a bowl of water and put in refrigerator (better digestibility)
- Potatoes can be bought pre-cut and peeled in jars
- Actually you can combine everything however you want,  
  As long as you always have 1x high protein (chickpeas/kidney beans/tofu)  
  and 1x high carbs (quinoa/freekeh/potatoes)

**Cooking Instructions**
- Everything is done with just one large pot
- First bring water to boil
- Rinse quinoa/freekeh with cold water
- Bring quinoa/freekeh to boil with triple the amount of water
- Cook on medium heat for ~10-15min
- Meanwhile prepare everything
- Drain and rinse beans/chickpeas in strainer (better digestibility)
- Place broccoli on a plate so it can thaw a bit
- Drain and rinse corn/peas&carrots/mushrooms with cold water in strainer
- Collect everything on a large plate
- By now almost 10-15min have passed
- Add all prepared ingredients to the pot
- Add 350ml tomato passata
- Add all spices
- Stir well
- Let simmer for another ~15 min (around setting 3.5)
- Cut onion and garlic for toppings
- Put portion on plate and add the toppings
- Enjoy! :)
