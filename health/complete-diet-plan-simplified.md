<summary>Cooking Instructions</summary>

**Notes:**
- The gram amounts for jars are already the drained weight
- I only buy everything in jars, no cans; and always organic
- Fresh vegetables taste better of course, but the nutrients in jars are almost the same
- Soak freekeh the evening before in a bowl of water and put in refrigerator (better digestibility)

**Cooking Instructions**
- Everything is done with just one large pot
- First bring water to boil
- Rinse quinoa / soaked freekeh / bulgur with cold water and put into pot
- Bring pot to boil with triple the amount of water
- Cook on medium heat for ~10-15min
- Meanwhile prepare everything
- Drain and rinse beans / chickpeas in strainer (better digestibility)
- Cut tofu in little cubes
- Cut carrots
- Place broccoli on a plate so it can thaw a bit
- Collect everything on a large plate
- By now ~ 10min have passed
- Add all prepared ingredients to the pot
- Add 350ml tomato passata
- Add all spices
- Stir well
- Let simmer for another ~15 min (low-mid heat ~ 3.5/9)
- Cut onion and garlic for toppings
